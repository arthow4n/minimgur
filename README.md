# Minimgur

A minimal Imgur anonymous uploader client for Android, written in React Native.

## THIS IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED

Consider using other apps like QuickIB (formerly Quickimgur) which should do similar things, I haven't tried though.

I myself don't really use Imgur anymore so it's unlikely I'll come back and fix the app. It's a known issue that this doesn't run on Pixel 7, and will no longer show up in Google Play Store after a while due me not maintaining and updating the app anymore.
